# Ball Trajectory Simulation with Kalman Filter and Bounce Effect

This project simulates the trajectory of a ball launched with a given speed and angle while incorporating the effects of gravity and bounce. The simulation also applies a Kalman Filter to estimate the ball's position from noisy observations, providing a comparison between the true trajectory and the estimated trajectory.

## Features

- **Trajectory Simulation**: Models the motion of a ball under the influence of gravity and includes bounce effects when the ball hits the ground.
- **Kalman Filter**: Implements a Kalman Filter to estimate the ball's position based on noisy measurements.
- **Noise Handling**: Adds Gaussian noise to the observations to simulate measurement inaccuracies.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the Kalman Filter's performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots the true trajectory, noisy observations, and Kalman Filter estimates for visual comparison.

## Parameters

- `dt`: Time interval for the simulation (default: 0.1 seconds).
- `total_time`: Total duration of the simulation (default: 10 seconds).
- `observation_noise_cov`: Covariance matrix for observation noise.
- `launch_params`: Dictionary containing launch position, speed, and angle.
- `init_state_mean`: Initial state mean for the Kalman Filter, including position and velocity.
- `init_state_cov`: Covariance matrix for the initial state estimate.
- `transition_cov`: Process noise covariance matrix.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The simulation starts by setting the initial position and velocity of the ball and initializing the Kalman Filter with the given parameters.
2. **Simulation Loop**: 
    - The ball's position and velocity are updated at each time step.
    - If the ball hits the ground, its position is reflected, and its vertical velocity is reversed and reduced to simulate energy loss on impact.
    - Noisy observations are generated based on the current position.
    - The Kalman Filter uses these observations to estimate the ball's position.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: The difference between the true and estimated positions is used to calculate MSE and RMSE, providing a quantitative measure of the filter's accuracy.
4. **Visualization**: The results are plotted, showing the true trajectory, noisy observations, and Kalman Filter estimates.

## Visualization Example

The plot generated by this simulation illustrates:
- **True Ball Trajectory**: The actual path of the ball under the influence of gravity and bounce.
- **Noisy Observations**: The measurements with added noise, simulating real-world sensor inaccuracies.
- **Kalman Filter Estimate**: The estimated trajectory using the Kalman Filter, showing how well the filter tracks the true path.

## Execution Time

The script also measures and prints the total execution time, providing insights into the computational efficiency of the simulation.
